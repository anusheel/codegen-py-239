# CRUD generator for FastAPI


In this example, we will create a CRUD generator for FastAPI.

```stub
Create a high quality codebase with FastAPI for all the CRUD API endpoints with the following entities:
- User, with attributes : name, email

Assume that the project directory has already been created and that you are inside that directory when running any commands. 
Dont include bash command to run the process.
```
