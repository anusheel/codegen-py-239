# CRUD generator for NestJS and TypeORM


In this example, we will create a CRUD generator for NestJS and TypeORM.

```stub
Create a high quality codebase with NestJS and TypeORM for all the CRUD API endpoints with the following entities:
- User, with attributes : name, email

Use nest generate resource command. For nest new command, use --package-manager and --directory . to specify the current directory where the project should be created. Assume that the project directory has already been created and that you are inside that directory when running any commands. 
Dont include bash command to run the process.
```

```stub
